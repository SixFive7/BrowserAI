# The tool surface and the artifacts it writes

**Versions in force** unless an entry says otherwise: `@playwright/mcp` 0.0.79 · `playwright-core` 1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05 · Windows 11 Pro 26200.
Measured on [the reference machine](../README.md#the-reference-machine).

## The tool surface and the package shape

Read from the shipped tree during the 2026-08-13 feasibility research unless a
later date is given. `@playwright/mcp` 0.0.79.

**`@playwright/mcp` is a 20-line shim.** The whole package is `cli.js`,
`index.js` and type definitions. `index.js` in full:

```js
const { tools } = require('playwright-core/lib/coreBundle');
module.exports = { createConnection: tools.createConnection };
```

The implementation is `playwright-core/lib/coreBundle.js` — **3.4 MB**,
esbuild-bundled. `[FLOATS]`

**Three tool counts, and a golden test written against the wrong one fails on
day one.** **78** entries in the internal registry array; **69** the maximum ever
exposed over MCP (9 are `skillOnly` and always stripped); **24** the default with
no `capabilities` set. The founding-bug reproduction saw the 24 over a real
`tools/list`. `Verified 2026-08-16 @ @playwright/mcp 0.0.79 / playwright-core
1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05`: all three re-measured, the 78 and the 9 by reading
`browserTools` in-process and the 24 and 69 over a real `tools/list`. They now
regenerate into
[`upstream-snapshots/tools-list.json`](../../upstream-snapshots/tools-list.json)
on every build, so a move is a diff rather than a memory. `[FLOATS]`

**The `storage` capability is 17 tools** — the cookie / localStorage /
`storageState` set. The legacy `interactive` server ran without it, so in that
process they did not exist at all.

### The per-capability breakdown, counted

**Measured 2026-08-16 @ `@playwright/mcp` 0.0.79 / `playwright-core`
1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05.** Re-establish it by regenerating the snapshot:
`pwsh -File build/Update-UpstreamSnapshots.ps1 -Accept`, which reads
`browserTools` from the resolved bundle and cross-checks every number against a
real `tools/list`. `[FLOATS]`

| Capability | Tools it carries | Of those, `skillOnly` | Surface with it alone |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core` | 21 | 2 | unconditional |
| `core-input` | 7 | 5 | unconditional |
| `core-navigation` | 4 | 2 | unconditional |
| `core-tabs` | 1 | 0 | unconditional |
| `core-install` | **0** | — | unconditional, and carries nothing |
| `config` | 1 | 0 | 25 |
| `network` | 4 | 0 | 28 |
| `pdf` | 1 | 0 | 25 |
| `storage` | 17 | 0 | 41 |
| `testing` | 5 | 0 | 29 |
| `vision` | 6 | 0 | 30 |
| `devtools` | 11 | 0 | 35 |
| **all twelve** | **78** | **9** | **69** |

**The `core` family is unconditional, and that is why every column above starts
at 24.** `filteredTools(config)` is
`browserTools.filter(t => t.capability.startsWith("core") || config.capabilities?.includes(t.capability)).filter(t => !t.skillOnly)`,
so the five `core*` capabilities are on whatever `capabilities` says — setting
`capabilities: ["config"]` yields **25** tools, not 1. Naming a `core*`
capability explicitly therefore does nothing, and **no configuration can reduce
the surface below the base 24**. `[FLOATS]`

**The nine `skillOnly` tools, by name:** `browser_console_clear`,
`browser_network_clear` (`core`); `browser_press_sequentially`,
`browser_keydown`, `browser_keyup`, `browser_check`, `browser_uncheck`
(`core-input`); `browser_navigate_forward`, `browser_reload`
(`core-navigation`). They are in the registry, they are never in a `tools/list`,
and the property is `tool.skillOnly` on the registry entry rather than anything
on the schema. `[FLOATS]`

**What BrowserAI's own modes expose, measured over the wire rather than added
up:** `config` + `vision` + `devtools` gives **42**, and `persistent` adding
`storage` gives **59** ([the session modes](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#sessions)).
Those are the same two numbers the `createConnection` experiment below produced
from two connections in one process, which is a second, independent route to
them. `[FLOATS]`

> **Re-established a third way 2026-08-16, and it is now the one that runs on

**One node process can serve several configurations.** Verified: two connections
built through the programmatic `createConnection` API produced correctly
divergent surfaces — **42 vs 59 tools** — with no module-global browser state and
browsers created lazily on first tool call. It is reachable only through that
API, which is why the charter rejects it on scope rather than on capability.
`[FLOATS]`

**`playwright-core` whitelists `"./lib/coreBundle"` in its `exports` map**, so
`require('playwright-core/lib/coreBundle')` is a supported import, not a blocked
deep path. It exposes `browserTools` (a flat array of plain, inert objects),
`filteredTools`, `createConnection` and `BrowserBackend`. `defineTool` is the
identity function — no class, no registry, no side effect. No type definitions
and no semver guarantee attach to it. `[FLOATS]`

**The `playwright` package (4.85 MB) is a declared dependency that is never
loaded.** Prunable, but `npm ls` then calls the tree broken. `[FLOATS]`

**`core-install` is declared in `config.d.ts` but no tool carries it** in 0.0.79 —
a dead capability string; setting it does nothing. `[FLOATS]`

**Upstream publishes daily alpha builds of `playwright-core`.**
`@playwright/mcp@latest` is the released dist-tag; the `playwright-core` alpha
beneath it arrives as that package's own **exact** dependency (no `^`, no `~`),
which is what makes the browser revision pinned while the package is not.
`[FLOATS]`

## Tools that reach credentials

**`browser_run_code_unsafe` returns an `httpOnly` cookie against the default
surface.** Demonstrated 2026-08-14: with the default **24-tool** surface and zero
`browser_cookie_*` tools exposed, `async (page) => page.context().cookies()`
returned an `httpOnly` bearer token. The tool is in `core`, so **no capability
setting removes it**. It was the *only* hole — `browser_evaluate` →
`document.cookie` returns `""`, and `browser_network_request` strips `Cookie` and
`Set-Cookie`. `[FLOATS]`

**`browser_storage_state` and the cookie tools return `httpOnly` cookies** —
session bearer tokens JavaScript cannot read. Any mode permitted to call them is
credential-bearing. `[FLOATS]`

**`browser_storage_state` never captures IndexedDB.** It calls `storageState()`
with no options, so `{indexedDB: true}` is never passed. A persistent profile
carries IndexedDB, so a "saved" session silently omits it and the tool is
*weaker* than doing nothing. `[FLOATS]`

**`browser_get_config` does not redact.** Its handler is
`JSON.stringify(context.config, null, 2)` with no filtering, so it emits
`config.secrets` in plaintext if that key is ever set. It is not set today.
`[FLOATS]`

**`browser_annotate` opens a dashboard window and blocks until a human finishes
drawing** — and the window appears in headless too. `[FLOATS]`

**`config.secrets` is a real key, so `browser_get_config` can disclose one.**
`--secrets <path>` is on the CLI and `secrets?: Record<string, string>` is in
`config.d.ts`, and the handler serialises the whole config with no filtering.
BrowserAI never writes the key and never passes the flag, so the answer is
forwarded byte-identical on every ordinary call and refused only if a `secrets`
key comes back. `Verified 2026-08-16 @ @playwright/mcp 0.0.79` from the committed
`cli-help.txt` and `config-schema.d.ts` snapshots. `[FLOATS]`

### What BrowserAI's own modes permit, after its own filtering

**Re-measured 2026-08-18 @ `@playwright/mcp` 0.0.79 / `playwright-core`
1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05, and corrected from 41 / 41 / 58.** Upstream's per-mode
surfaces are 42 / 42 / 59 above; these are what survives BrowserAI's own decision,
out of the **59-tool union** it advertises to every caller. Re-establish by
running `SessionPolicyTests.EveryModePermitsEveryToolItAdvertisesExceptTheOneThatWouldHang`,
which computes the union from the committed snapshot and asks the product's own
decision function about every name in it. `[FLOATS]`

| Mode | Permitted | Refused, and why |
|---|---:|---|
| `headless` | **58** | `browser_annotate`, whose window appears even here and then blocks until a human draws in it |
| `interactive` | **59** | nothing |
| `persistent` | **59** | nothing |

⚠️ **Corrected 2026-08-18 (previously "`headless` **41** — the 17 `storage`
tools; `browser_annotate` … `interactive` **41** — the 17 `storage` tools;
`browser_run_code_unsafe`, which reaches the same cookies through the Playwright
server process … `persistent` **58** — `browser_annotate`", and beside the table
"the classification behind them is 69 names in five classes — 49 ordinary, 17
`storage`, and one each of `ArbitraryCode`, `HumanPresent` and `Configuration`").**
The `(tool, mode)` permission matrix was removed. **It was never a boundary
against the caller:** the calling agent chooses the session directory, the profile
and its cookie database are created inside it, and the agent runs as the same
Windows user, so DPAPI decrypts for it — an agent holding any file tool reads what
the matrix declined to return. The one refusal left is **liveness, not security**:
`browser_annotate` blocks until a human draws, and the dashboard window appears on
a windowless session too, so an unattended run that called it would hang until it
was killed.

**The `storage` tools are still absent from a windowless session's child**, and
that is a different mechanism which did not change: a `headless` or `interactive`
session's child is started **without the `storage` capability**, so those 17 tools
do not exist in that process at all. They are still *advertised*, because the MCP
spec forbids the tool set varying per connection — so calling one on such a
session now reaches the child and gets upstream's *"unknown tool"* rather than a
BrowserAI sentence naming the mode that would permit it. That is the one thing the
removal cost a model, and it is recorded here rather than argued away.
`browser_run_code_unsafe` was never coverable that way in any case: it is in
`core`, which upstream ors in unconditionally, so **it is reachable from every
mode** — as it always was from `headless` and `persistent`. `[FLOATS]`

## Artifacts and output-directory behaviour

All read from the shipped bundle or observed against a real child. `[FLOATS]`

**Playwright writes every artifact flat into one directory with a generated
name**, mixing machine churn with hand-named work. Fixed generator prefixes make
classification exact rather than heuristic.

> 1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05 (previously: "**Nine fixed generator prefixes**:

**The empty prefix is the traces template, and `traces\` is upstream's folder
rather than ours.** The call is
`context.outputFile({ prefix: "", suggestedFilename: "traces", ext: "" }, { origin: "code" })`,
which resolves to `<outputDir>/traces`. So it is correct that `traces` is *not* a
generator prefix — the template supplies its own name — and wrong to describe the
folder as one we chose: upstream computes that path and BrowserAI cannot
configure it. `Verified 2026-08-16 @ playwright-core 1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-05`
against `coreBundle.js`. `[FLOATS]`

**The generated name format is `page-2026-08-14T04-11-50-882Z.png`** — a
timestamp, which is precisely what made 346 accumulated session directories
untriageable. The template is
``template.suggestedFilename || `${prefix}-${date.toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g,"-")}${ext ? "." + ext : ""}` ``,
so **a supplied `suggestedFilename` replaces the whole generated name, prefix
included.** `[FLOATS]`

**A caller-supplied `filename` and a generated name resolve against *different*
roots**, which is the fact routing turns on. Measured 2026-08-16 by reading
`coreBundle.js`:

| Path | Function | Resolves against |
|---|---|---|
| `filename` given (`suggestedFilename`) | `workspaceFile(name, cwd)` | `path.resolve(options.cwd, name)` — **the child's cwd** |
| no `filename` | `outputFile(name)` | `path.resolve(config.outputDir, name)` — **the configured output directory** |

That is the whole reason ten repositories currently run a `deny` hook on
`browser_take_screenshot`, and it is closed by setting the child's
`WorkingDirectory` instead of by a hook. Setting the working directory **to the
output directory** makes the two roots coincide, which matters for the check
below. `[FLOATS]`

**Upstream refuses a path outside its own roots, and the message names them.**
`checkFile` returns early for `origin: "code"`, `allowUnrestrictedFileAccess` or
`skillMode`, and otherwise throws
`File access denied: <path> is outside allowed roots. Allowed roots: <outputDir>, <cwd>`.
So a caller-supplied `filename` is already confined by upstream — but only to
those two roots, and only with a message a model has to parse. `[FLOATS]`

**A download lands in the output directory, not in `downloadsPath`.**
`_downloadStarted` calls
`outputFile({ suggestedFilename: sanitize(download.suggestedFilename()), prefix: "download", ext: "bin" }, { origin: "code" })`
and then `download.saveAs(...)`, so the saved copy is
`<outputDir>\<site-suggested-name>` and carries the `download-` prefix **only
when the site suggests no name at all**. `launchOptions.downloadsPath` is where
Playwright keeps the raw artifact, not where the visible file ends up. `[FLOATS]`

**`browser_take_screenshot`'s image format comes from `type` before the file
name.** `fileType = params.type ?? <from filename extension> ?? "png"`, so
supplying a `.png` name to a call that asked for `jpeg` yields jpeg bytes in a
file called `.png`. Any proxy that supplies a name must read `type` first.
`[FLOATS]`

**`browser_start_video` throws on any extension but `.webm`** —
`if (!outputFile.endsWith(".webm")) throw new Error("File must have .webm extension")`
in `FfmpegVideoRecorder`'s constructor. `[FLOATS]`

**Eleven tools carry a `filename` argument and two of them are reads.**
`browser_run_code_unsafe` ("Load code from the specified file") and
`browser_set_storage_state` ("Path to the storage state file to restore from")
both route through `resolveClientFilename` → `workspaceFile`, so they read
relative to the child's cwd and are subject to the same `checkFile`. The other
nine write. Counted 2026-08-16 from the committed `tools-list.json` snapshot;
`ArtifactRoutingTests.EveryToolCarryingAFilenameHasBeenJudged` re-counts it on
every build. `[FLOATS]`

**Sorting the output root costs ~118 µs per call on this machine.** Measured
2026-08-16, 5,000 iterations twice: a non-recursive
`Directory.EnumerateFiles` over an empty directory holding twelve subdirectories
returned in **115.3 µs** and **120.1 µs** per call (NTFS, Defender on).
That is the per-`tools/call` price of classifying the artifacts that cannot be
routed inbound — a download, whose name the site chose, and an annotation, whose
name upstream chose. `[MACHINE]`

**Pre-creating the typed folders costs 4× what creating three does.** Measured
2026-08-16, 120 sessions per pass, twice: a session directory plus the three
`profile` / `output` / `downloads` folders takes **2.50–2.63 ms**; the same plus
all eleven typed artifact folders takes **10.39–10.46 ms**. Reclaiming the whole
tree afterwards costs proportionally more again. At roughly 120 sessions per
suite run that is about a second each way, which is why BrowserAI creates a typed
folder on first use rather than up front — and why a folder that exists in a
session directory means an artifact of that kind was actually produced.
`[MACHINE]`

**`_meta.json`, `_meta.cwd` and `_meta.raw` are read by the child before zod
parsing** and stripped before the tool sees them. Undocumented but real, and
available for a proxy to inject (JSON error format, relative-path base).

**Killed children leak `browser@<guid>` descriptors.** Each is a JSON file in the
browsers-registry root holding the absolute `userDataDir` and `workspaceDir`;
`BrowserServer.stop()` removes them only when there is **no** `userDataDir`. **28
were observed and removed on 2026-08-14** (`[MACHINE]` for the count). The
registry root sits at `%LocalAppData%\BrowserAI\browsers\`, outside `current\` under the current design — a tree
that should be read-only and is wiped on update.

**Real screenshots are not byte-stable across runs**, so passthrough-fidelity
assertions need a canned blob from a fake child rather than a live capture.
