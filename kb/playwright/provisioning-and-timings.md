# Payload sizes, first-run provisioning and timings

## Component sizes

Measured during the 2026-08-13 research. Every row is a version-specific artifact
size, so every row is `[FLOATS]`.

| Component | Version / revision | Size |
|---|---|---:|
| `node.exe` | v24.19.0 LTS | 88.53 MB |
| `@playwright/mcp` + `playwright-core` tree | 0.0.79 | 18.11 MB |
| `chromium-headless-shell` | rev 1237 | 268.49 MB |
| `ffmpeg` | rev 1011 | 3.35 MB |
| `winldd` | rev 1007 | 0.25 MB |
| full `chromium` | rev 1237 (152.0.7977.8) | 426.88 MB |

**The six rows above total ~806 MB installed, ~239 MB compressed** — 7z LZMA2
`-mx=5`. That is the figure for a **bundled** build, browsers inside the
installer, and it excludes BrowserAI's own binary. **Nothing ships in that shape
today.** Browsers are [provisioned on first run](#first-run-provisioning), so the
installed payload is `node.exe` + the JS tree + BrowserAI ≈ **117 MB**, and
**disk after first run is ~117 MB + 433 MiB ≈ 570 MB**. The ~806 MB total is kept
because a bundled build is the fallback if the Chrome-for-Testing redistribution
question is ever resolved favourably — but it is **not** the figure for disk
after first run, as this file and the charter both once said: it counts
`chrome-headless-shell` (268.49 MB), which is not provisioned at all.

**BrowserAI's own binary is 9.76 MiB** — 10,233,856 bytes, `PublishAot`, win-x64,
self-contained, measured by
[the 2026-08-15 spike](../mcp/sdk.md#measured-by-spike-2026-08-15). This retires
the "~10–15 MB `[UNVERIFIED]`" estimate that stood here after the measurement
that replaced it, which is the same defect as everything under
[corrections](../history.md#corrections-applied-2026-08-15-late): an estimate
outliving its own measurement. The trimmed self-contained fallback at ~70 MB is
still `[UNVERIFIED]`, nothing having been built in that configuration.

**A single `node.exe` drives the full MCP protocol** — no npm, no `node_modules`
belonging to Node, no `.cmd` shims. Verified by execution. Node **v26 is Current
rather than LTS and its `node.exe` is 10 MB larger**. `[FLOATS]`

**The vendored JS tree contains zero native binaries** and is portable as-is.
**`ffmpeg` is required for video capture** — without it the `video` artifact type
throws. `[FLOATS]`

## First-run provisioning

**Settled 2026-08-15 by exact `content-length` from the CDN: 203.8 MB down,
433 MiB on disk.** `chrome-win64.zip` 202,283,919 B + `ffmpeg-win64.zip`
1,411,741 B + `winldd-win64.zip` 128,684 B; on disk, chromium 428 MiB + ffmpeg 4
+ winldd 1. Arithmetic for slower links: **2 m 43 s at 10 Mbps, 27 m 11 s at
1 Mbps**. Peak disk during provisioning is **~640 MiB**, while the archive and
the extracted tree coexist. **This file is where that number lives** — the rest
of the repository cites it rather than restating it. `[FLOATS]`

**End to end it took 20.3 s on a 300 Mbps link**, measured 2026-08-14. That run
also fetched `chrome-headless-shell`, so it is an upper bound on today's
provisioning rather than a measurement of it. `[FLOATS]`

**In-session recovery is proven.** The same child navigates successfully once the
install lands, with no restart. `[FLOATS]`

**The revision is pinned for free and is never looked up online.**
`playwright-core/browsers.json` carries the revision and `browserVersion`; the URL
is built by substituting that version into a template that **307s** to Google's
bucket. That file is inside the artifact and **no "latest" lookup exists anywhere
in the registry code**, so a release knows forever which browser it wants. Old
builds still resolve back to **Chrome 115 (Jul 2023)** — about three years of
evidence — but **Google documents no retention policy**, so it is evidence and
not a guarantee. `[FLOATS]`

**Egress hosts:** `cdn.playwright.dev`, `storage.googleapis.com`,
`playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com`. `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` /
`NO_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` and **`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`** are honoured on the
download path; **SOCKS is not supported** there. `[FLOATS]`

**`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` must be absolute.** A relative value resolves
against `INIT_CWD` — inherited from any npm ancestor — before `cwd`. `[FLOATS]`

**Layout under the browsers root, verified by execution:** `[FLOATS]`

```
<browsers-root>\
  chromium_headless_shell-1237\chrome-headless-shell-win64\chrome-headless-shell.exe
  chromium-1237\chrome-win64\chrome.exe
  ffmpeg-1011\ffmpeg-win64.exe
```

Note the asymmetry: the **outer** directory uses underscores, the **inner** one
dashes, so a path built consistently is wrong. **No sentinel file is needed to
launch** — not `INSTALLATION_COMPLETE`, not `DEPENDENCIES_VALIDATED`; the only
launch-time check is file accessibility of the executable. `.links/` records the
**build machine's** absolute paths and is useless on the target.

**`DEPENDENCIES_VALIDATED` is written into the browsers root on first launch.**
Under `Program Files` that write silently fails and the validation re-runs every
launch. Prefer `%LOCALAPPDATA%` or a `%ProgramData%` path with write ACLs.
`[FLOATS]`

**Node SEA, `pkg` and `nexe` are dead ends.** `playwright-core` violates SEA's
"no filesystem module loading" constraint in **five verified ways**: `packageRoot`
computed from `__dirname`; a runtime `require` of `browsers.json` at a computed
path; two `childProcess.fork()` calls on sibling scripts; sibling bundle
requires; and `.wasm`/`vite` assets loaded by path. SEA would also save nothing —
its output *is* a copy of `node.exe` plus the blob. `vercel/pkg` was archived
**2024-01-13**. Bun and Deno both carry open issues on the Playwright
browser-launch path. `[FLOATS]`

## Timings: spawn, resume, idle close, proxy overhead

`[MACHINE]` for every number, `[FLOATS]` for what they are numbers *about*.

> ⚠️ **Only the resume figure carries a date in the charter.** Spawn, navigation,
> idle close and proxy overhead are all recorded undated, so treat their dates as
> `[UNVERIFIED]` and re-stamp each at the next run. The numbers themselves are

**Child spawn costs ~300 ms.** That is the baseline a flat 5 s discovery probe
would be paid against ([the protocol split](../mcp/protocol.md#the-protocol-split)), and the
per-instance price of one node child per handle.

**A real navigation costs 0.43 s** — `browser_navigate` to
`data:text/html,<h1>ok</h1>`, no network and no local server. `about:blank`
succeeds too trivially and its snapshot is empty, which is why the smoke
assertion uses a `data:` URL.

**Browser-idle close recovers 329 MB → 110 MB, and relaunch costs 186 ms.**
Closing the browser while keeping the node child is therefore cheap enough that a
caller navigating afterwards need never see "browser is closed".

**Resume costs 515 ms and loses only `sessionStorage`.** Measured 2026-08-14:
after killing the node child, a resume against the recorded directory preserved
cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers and CacheStorage. This is the
measurement the no-expiry-timer decision rests on — the durable thing is the
profile, not the process.

**Proxying costs ~50 ms on a 500 KB payload.** From an equivalent Node prototype:
images passed through byte-identical (**509,620** base64 bytes), error shapes
preserved, ~50 ms added latency, ~300 ms one-off child spawn. It measured a
**Node** prototype rather than the C# proxy, so it is `[UNVERIFIED]` as a
prediction of BrowserAI's own overhead — a precedent, not a measurement of this
product.

**Suite costs, for cadence decisions:** real-child contract 2–5 s, smoke 10–30 s,
update 1–3 min. Estimates, not stopwatch figures. `[UNVERIFIED]`
