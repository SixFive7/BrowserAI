# The MCP protocol, and the client at the other end

## The protocol split

**`@playwright/mcp` 0.0.79 caps at protocol `2025-11-25`.** The child never
*rejects* a version — it caps or echoes silently: verified, offering
`1999-01-01` returned `2025-11-25` with no error, so a mis-negotiation produces
nothing to catch and the negotiated value must be asserted. `[FLOATS]`

**The current spec is `2026-07-28`, a breaking rewrite.** It removes `initialize`
and `notifications/initialized`, adds `server/discover`, replaces server→client
requests with the MRTR retry pattern, and deprecates Roots, Sampling and Logging.
**SEP-2567 removed protocol-level sessions outright**, and *Tools § Capabilities*
states the tool set "MAY change over time … but MUST NOT vary per-connection or
as a side effect of other requests on the connection." `ping` was removed at
`2026-07-28`. SEP-2567 also names `destroy_*` and `list_*` as the documented
companions to a creation tool. `[STABLE]` — a published revision does not move.

**The .NET SDK implements every revision from `2024-11-05` through `2026-07-28`**
and shipped `2026-07-28` support on the spec's release date. `[FLOATS]`

**`DiscoverProbeTimeout` is 5 seconds by default.** With the client version left
unpinned, the client probes the child with `server/discover` first; if the child
drops the unknown method rather than answering, **every child spawn costs a flat
5 s against a ~300 ms baseline**, presenting as "browser automation got slow"
with no error anywhere. The SDK's own test base class pins it explicitly, citing
[csharp-sdk#1701](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/issues/1701)
— CI slowness tripped the probe there. `[FLOATS]`

## The client: Claude Code

`[FLOATS]` on a client version this project does not control.

**Tool names and server `instructions` load eagerly; schemas are deferred.** So
`instructions` is the only channel that reaches the model before it calls
anything.

**Server `instructions` and every tool description are truncated silently at
2 KB.** The tail simply does not exist and nothing reports it.

**`notifications/tools/list_changed` handling changed, and the charter's citation
is stale.** *"Claude Code registers no handler"* was accurate at **2.0.65**
(Dec 2025) — issues
[#13646](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13646) and
[#4118](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4118). At **2.1.231 it
is false**: measured twice, the client re-listed in **1–2 ms** and the model
called a tool that appeared only in the second list. This does **not** unlock a
per-connection tool list — SEP-2567 stands — but the cited issues need re-dating.

## Tooling around the protocol

**`claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get` exit 0 even when the server is dead** —
unusable as a CI gate without grepping stdout for `✘`. **The official MCP
conformance suite is HTTP-only** (`--url`), so it needs a test-only listener or a
small bridge to reach a stdio server. **The Inspector CLI cannot spawn `.cmd`
shims on Windows** — same root cause as
[#58510](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/58510) — so address
`cli.js` by absolute path; its **exit code 5 means the tool reported `isError`**,
which is the signal `claude mcp` does not give you. `[FLOATS]`
